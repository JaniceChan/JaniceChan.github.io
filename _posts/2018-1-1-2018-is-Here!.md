### If you are reading this, you have chanced upon my blog! 
Welcome, my name is Janice. I am currently 22, I live in Toronto, and I recently graduated from the University of Toronto as a Specialist in Computer Science. I worked as a co-op at Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP), and CIBC. Currently, I am an Automation Engineer at RBC. This blog is to help me document my thoughts, share tutorials/interesting content, and generate discussion.  

This year will be an exciting one! Recapping from 2017:
{{ content | replace: '<li>[ ]', '<li class = "box">' | replace: '<li>[x]', '<li class = "box_done">'  }}
- [x] Graduation
- [x] Full-time job
- [x] Find a flat
- [ ] ...now what?

I have a few things in mind for what is to come. Budget and save money, swim twice a week, sign up for driving school, pursue a CFA, sponsor a child, adopt a cat, consider/consult for a phoenix tattoo, travel to Tokyo and Osaka, cruise to Alaska... 
Over everything, I want to keep in touch with my friends, and spend quality time with my family. This means I need to budget both time and money!

What are you looking forward to for the upcoming year? What are your short-term and long-term goals? 

Wishing everyone a very happy new year! :tada:
