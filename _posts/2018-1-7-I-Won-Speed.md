### 2018 Life
Janice and I are currently at Robarts binge-watching How I Met Your Mother. I'm super happy to spend the last day of my winter break with her!

School starts again tomorrow and it's the last semester of my university life. I am wholly astounded that after years of being sleep-deprived, cramming assignments, procrastination, and all-night study sessions, it's coming to an end. Like all ends, new beginnings are not far around the corner.

I'm thinking about that HIMYM episode about dopplegangers, because it talks about how we are all just people who look like us, but are nothing like our former selves.

I think about the person I was when I met Janice for the first time at Math in Motion, and how we are no longer those people, but are still super close (if not closer!)

I hope the new year brings lots of new and exciting experiences and adventures for us. 

Here's to 2018!!!!!! :)
